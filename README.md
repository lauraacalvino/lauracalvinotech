## 🌱 What I Learned

While building this project, I improved my understanding of:

- Structuring large layouts with CSS Grid & Flexbox  
- Creating design systems with CSS variables  
- Implementing scroll-based animations using Intersection Observer  
- Managing responsive behavior with media queries  
- Writing cleaner, more modular CSS  
- Enhancing UX through subtle motion and hover states  
- Planning UI before coding (Figma → implementation)  
- Organizing a multi-section website from scratch  

It also helped reinforce how design and development connect — especially when translating visual ideas into real interfaces.

## 📍 The Process

This project started as a way to create a personal space where I could bring together all my creative disciplines.

I wanted something minimal but expressive — mixing soft gradients, subtle animations, and clean layout structures. Instead of using frameworks, I chose vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to strengthen my core front-end fundamentals.

I focused on:

- Building a clear content hierarchy
- Creating reusable UI patterns (cards, buttons, tags)
- Adding motion through Intersection Observer
- Designing a timeline for experience
- Making everything responsive without libraries

The goal was to make a portfolio that feels warm, modern, and personal while still being technically solid.
